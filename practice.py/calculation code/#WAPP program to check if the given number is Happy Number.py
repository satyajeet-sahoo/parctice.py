#WAPP program to check if the given number is Happy Number
#A number is said to be happy if it yields 1 when replaced by the sum of squares of its digits repeatedly.
#If this process results in an endless cycle of numbers containing 4, then the number will be an unhappy number.
#Number = 32
#32+ 22 = 13
#12 + 32 = 10
#12 + 02 = 1
#isHappyNumber() will determine whether a number is happy or not

    #Calculates the sum of squares of digits

        rem = num%10;    
        sum = sum + (rem*rem);
