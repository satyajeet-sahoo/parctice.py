#WAPP to print all pronic numbers between 1 and 100
#The pronic number is a product of two consecutive integers of the form: n(n+1).
#For example:6 = 2(2+1)= n(n+1),72 =8(8+1) = n(n+1)Some pronic numbers are: 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56 etc.
#isPronicNumber() will determine whether a given number is a pronic number or not
